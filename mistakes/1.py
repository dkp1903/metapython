# While looking through the Localstack codebase, I was able to find extensive use of decorators

# I find these analogous to annotations in Java

# However, in python, the lower your decorator is, the higher priority it's given. The same rule doesn't apply in Java, and can be overridden/customized using @Order.

# This is one place where one needs to be careful
